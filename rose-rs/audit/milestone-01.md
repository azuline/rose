# Milestone 1 Audit Report: Foundation

## Executive Summary

The Rust implementation of Milestone 1 (Foundation) provides a solid base with most core functionality implemented correctly. The implementation demonstrates good Rust practices, comprehensive test coverage exceeding the Python baseline, and maintains behavioral compatibility with the original Python code.

## Scope Review

According to the plan, Milestone 1 should include:
- Artist type with name and alias flag
- ArtistMapping for organizing artists by role
- Error hierarchy matching Python's structure
- Utility functions: UUID validation, filename sanitization, file type detection
- Constants for supported audio/image extensions

## Implementation Assessment

### ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented

1. **Artist Type** (`common.rs:11-33`)
   - Correctly implements `Artist` struct with name and alias fields
   - Proper `Hash` implementation matching Python's `__hash__`
   - Constructors `new()` and `with_alias()` for convenience

2. **ArtistMapping** (`common.rs:34-77`)
   - All role fields present (main, guest, remixer, producer, composer, conductor, djmixer)
   - `all()` method correctly returns unique artists across all roles
   - `items()` iterator matches Python's implementation
   - Proper use of `uniq()` to deduplicate artists

3. **Utility Functions**
   - `flatten()`: Correctly flattens nested vectors
   - `uniq()`: Preserves order while removing duplicates (matches Python behavior)
   - `sanitize_dirname()` and `sanitize_filename()`: Properly handle illegal characters and NFD normalization
   - File type detection with case-insensitive checks

4. **Error Hierarchy** (`error.rs`)
   - Proper separation between `RoseError` and `RoseExpectedError`
   - All required error types implemented
   - Additional error types for better error handling (InvalidUuid, FileNotFound, InvalidFileFormat)
   - Uses `thiserror` for idiomatic error handling

5. **Constants**
   - Supported audio extensions: mp3, m4a, ogg, opus, flac
   - Supported image extensions: jpg, jpeg, png

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

1. **Missing UUID Validation**
   - The plan calls for UUID validation function, but none is implemented
   - Tests expect UUID validation but the functionality is missing

2. **Incomplete sha256_dataclass Implementation**
   - Current implementation uses Debug formatting instead of properly hashing dataclass fields
   - Python version recursively hashes fields in a deterministic way
   - This could lead to different hashes between Python and Rust versions

3. **Sanitization Differences**
   - The Rust implementation doesn't handle UTF-8 byte truncation the same way as Python
   - Python implementation is more careful about truncating at valid UTF-8 boundaries
   - Missing special handling for "." and ".." filenames (should become "_" according to plan)

4. **Logging Implementation**
   - Very basic compared to Python's robust logging setup
   - Missing file logging, log rotation, platform-specific paths
   - Uses `tracing` instead of matching Python's logging configuration

### üìä Test Coverage Analysis

**Python Tests**: 0 (no common_test.py exists)  
**Rust Tests**: 28 (exceeds the minimum 20 required)

The Rust implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Artist creation and hashing
- ArtistMapping operations
- All utility functions with edge cases
- Error hierarchy and conversions
- File type detection
- Filename sanitization with Unicode

### üîç Additional Features Beyond Python

1. **Better Error Types**: More specific error variants with contextual information
2. **Type Safety**: Leverages Rust's type system for compile-time guarantees
3. **Performance**: Uses lazy_static for regex compilation
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Zero-copy operations where possible

## Recommendations

1. **Implement UUID Validation**: Add a proper UUID validation function as specified in the plan
2. **Fix sha256_dataclass**: Implement proper recursive hashing matching Python's behavior
3. **Improve Sanitization**: Handle edge cases like "." and ".." and fix UTF-8 truncation
4. **Complete Logging**: Either match Python's logging more closely or document the differences
5. **Cross-Version Testing**: Add integration tests that verify compatibility with Python-generated data

## Conclusion

The Milestone 1 implementation provides a strong foundation with good test coverage and idiomatic Rust code. However, several key functions need refinement to ensure full compatibility with the Python version. The contractor has done well in establishing the core types and most utilities, but should address the missing UUID validation and improve the hashing/sanitization functions before proceeding to later milestones that depend on these foundations.

**Grade: B+** - Solid implementation with room for improvement in compatibility details.
